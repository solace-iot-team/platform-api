Solace Async API Management Connector
=====================================

The API Management Connector enables you to use Solace PS+ Services as
Async API Gateways. It provides a Management API that is aligned with
the management APIs of API Management platforms and therefore supports
managing entities such as APIs, API Products (Plans), Apps and so on.
Once apps are created all necessary access controls and event broker
resources are created and the developer is provided with credentials and
other information so they can develop their app.
